Web scraping using Python API


Save the following barcode IDs (Universal Product Code) in a text file:
685450116442
700596003606
792850892248
792850809994
792850889996
792850850996
Write a program (preferably in Python) that lookups the barcode values from the text file. Lookup product information for each bar code in a UPC database - Bar Code Spider
Save all product information onto a csv file. 
If a new product code is added to the file, the program should automatically lookup the product from the UPC database and append product information into the CSV file. 
Stress test your program before submission. 
Enlist the limitations of the program you are submitting
